# BenchMesh

**One cockpit for your whole test bench.**

Power supplies, multimeters, electronic loads, signal generators, oscilloscopes, LCR meters and
spectrum analyzers - connected over USB, serial or LAN, controlled from one window, recorded on
one shared timeline.

## Why BenchMesh

- **One panel per instrument type** - every power supply, meter or scope looks and works the same,
  whatever the brand.
- **Recording on one time domain** - readings from all instruments line up second by second;
  export to CSV.
- **Automation** - build flows with conditions by hand, or describe what you want and let an AI
  assistant (your own Anthropic, OpenAI or OpenRouter key) assemble them.
- **AI assistants via MCP** - connect Claude, Cursor and other MCP clients to your bench.
- **Hundreds of models** described by device definitions, no drivers to write; the
  [instrument database](https://benchmesh.online/instruments) shows what is supported.
- **Free, open source, offline** - Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Get it

Download the installer for your system from **[benchmesh.online/download](https://benchmesh.online/download)**
(install notes for each platform, including opening the app on macOS).

## Build from source

The current code is on the [`develop`](https://github.com/BenchMesh/benchmesh-app/tree/develop) branch (Rust + Tauri, React UI).
You need Rust (stable, via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)), Node.js 20 or newer and, for the desktop app,
the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system (on Linux the
WebKitGTK and GTK development packages).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenchMesh/benchmesh-app.git && cd benchmesh-app
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd -
cargo run -p bm-server        # API + UI on http://localhost:57666/ui
```

The desktop app needs the Tauri CLI (`cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"`). Build the frontend
first (as above): the app bundles what is in `frontend/dist`, and `cargo tauri build` does not build
it for you. Then, in `crates/benchmesh-app`:

```bash
cargo tauri dev               # run the app
cargo tauri build             # installers for your system in target/release/bundle/
```

## Open source and the official build

Everything BenchMesh does is in this repository, under the MIT license. The installers on
benchmesh.online are the **official build**: this code plus a few things that only the BenchMesh
project ships - automatic updates (signed) and, later, the BenchMesh online services. A build you
make yourself is a **community build**: the same application, without them. Details:
[ai_context/OPEN_CORE.md](https://github.com/BenchMesh/benchmesh-app/blob/develop/ai_context/OPEN_CORE.md).
