# Headless BenchMesh

BenchMesh without a window: the server alone, used from browsers on other computers through
remote access (`ai_context/REMOTE_ACCESS.md`). Typical use: a Raspberry Pi (or any small
computer) next to the bench with the instruments plugged into it, looked after entirely from a
laptop. Available on Linux (x64, 64-bit ARM), Windows and macOS.

## Starting it

The installed desktop app and the standalone server do the same:

```text
benchmesh --headless --remote-password '<at least 10 characters>'     # the desktop app's executable
benchmesh-server --remote-password '<at least 10 characters>'         # the server binary
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--remote-password P` | switches remote access on with this password; its hash is kept in `<data dir>/remote.json`, so later starts need no password. `BENCHMESH_REMOTE_PASSWORD` does the same without showing the password in process lists |
| `--port N` | loopback port (default 57666) |
| `--data-dir D` | user data (default `~/.benchmesh`, or `BENCHMESH_DATA_DIR`) |
| `--config F` | instruments (default `<data dir>/config.yaml`) |
| `--simulate CAPTURE` | replays a capture session (`captures/<session>`) instead of the instruments, also `BENCHMESH_SIMULATE`: no hardware is used, recordings, flows and settings stay in memory, and it never starts with the computer |

Anything else on the command line (an unknown option, an option without its value) is refused with
the usage and exit code 2, so a typo never starts a different BenchMesh than asked for; `--help`
prints the usage.

At start it prints the remote addresses (`https://<address>:57667/`) and the certificate
fingerprint to compare with the browser's warning. Without a password it warns that no other
computer can reach it. The headless app listens on 127.0.0.1:57666 only: it cannot run beside the
app window (both would open the same instruments). Ctrl-C / SIGTERM stops it cleanly (the
definitions' `on_disconnect` steps run). On Windows the app attaches to the terminal it was
started from for its output.

Code: `crates/bm-server/src/headless.rs` (shared runner), `crates/benchmesh-app/src/headless.rs`
(the app's resources), `crates/bm-server/src/main.rs`.

## Instruments - System

The UI's System tab (`frontend/src/ui/system/`) shows for every BenchMesh: host, OS,
architecture, cores, uptime, processor temperature (where the OS reports one: Linux incl.
Raspberry Pi; often none on Windows and macOS), load averages (not on Windows), processor and
memory use, the disk of the data directory, and BenchMesh's own memory and processor use; updated
every 2 s. Meters turn amber from 75 %, red from 90 %; the temperature from 70 / 80 °C (a Pi
throttles at 80).

Headless only (in the desktop app the window owns the process: these answer 409):

- **Restart** (two presses): devices stop cleanly, then the same command line starts again - on
  Unix in place (`exec`, same process id, so systemd / launchd keep tracking it), on Windows as a
  new process. Remote sessions live in memory: browsers sign in again (the page reloads by itself).
- **Shut down** (two presses): devices stop cleanly, the process exits with code 0.
- Both are refused (409) while a flow runs: its cleanup switches off what it switched on.
- **Start with this computer**: an entry for the user BenchMesh runs as (no administrator rights)
  that runs the same executable with `--headless` and the options given at start (never the
  password):

| OS | Entry | Starts |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | systemd user service `~/.config/systemd/user/benchmesh.service` (`Restart=on-failure`, enabled with `systemctl --user enable`) | at login; at power-on once the user lingers: `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"` (shown with Copy) |
| macOS | LaunchAgent `~/Library/LaunchAgents/online.benchmesh.headless.plist` (`KeepAlive` on unsuccessful exit) | at login (power-on with automatic login) |
| Windows | `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, value `BenchMeshHeadless` | at sign-in (power-on with automatic sign-in) |

A crash is restarted by systemd / launchd; Shut down (exit 0) is not. An AppImage registers the
AppImage file itself (`$APPIMAGE`), not its temporary mount. A simulation never starts with the
computer. Without a systemd user manager (Linux) the tab says so.

## Updates

A build of this repository does not update itself: build the new version again. The official
distribution adds **Updates** to Instruments - About (Check for updates, Install, the signed
download verified before it is installed) through its extension (`ai_context/OPEN_CORE.md`), which
stops and restarts the headless process with `System::hand_over`; the tab waits and reloads like
System does after Restart (`frontend/src/ui/system/comeback.tsx`).

## API (scope `system`, `crates/bm-server/src/system/`)

| Route | |
|---|---|
| `GET /system` | `{host, os, arch, cpus, uptime_s, load: [1, 5, 15] \| null, cpu_percent, memory: {total, used}, process: {pid, memory, cpu_percent, started_ms}, disk: {path, total, available} \| null, temperature_c \| null, headless, version}` (bytes) |
| `POST /system/restart`, `POST /system/shutdown` | 202 `{action}`; 409 in the desktop app or while a flow runs |
| `GET /system/autostart` | `{supported, enabled, method, location, starts_at: boot\|login, boot_command, note, reason, command}` |
| `PUT /system/autostart` `{enabled}` | as GET; 400 without `enabled`, 409 in the desktop app or a simulation |

Remote control sessions hold the `system` scope (headless, the browser is the only way to look
after the computer); view-only sessions read `GET /system` only. Restart, shut down and install
are not sent from the API reference drawer (`x-no-try`).

## Raspberry Pi

64-bit Raspberry Pi OS on a Pi 4 or 5: use `BenchMesh_<version>_aarch64.AppImage` (needs
`libfuse2`; it updates itself from the System tab) or install `BenchMesh_<version>_arm64.deb`
(`sudo apt install ./BenchMesh_*_arm64.deb`; updates need that command again), give the instruments
to the user (the udev rule / dialout group, https://benchmesh.online/docs/linux), run
`benchmesh --headless --remote-password '...'` once, then switch **Start with this computer** on
and run the linger command so it starts at power-on. The release builds ARM64 natively on
GitHub's ARM runners (official release build); CI builds and tests the desktop app on ARM on every
push.
