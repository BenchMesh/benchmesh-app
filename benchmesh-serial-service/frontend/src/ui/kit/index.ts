/**
 * BenchMesh instrument kit: the visual building blocks every instrument panel is made of
 * (skins in `kit.css`: Reflective LCD by default, LED segment, Cockpit glass; see `skin.tsx`).
 * Rules of use:
 * - Readout: measured values only (fixed digit count, ghost segments).
 * - DigitEditor: setpoints; nothing is sent until Enter.
 * - ArmSwitch: anything that energises (operations with `energizes`): two presses to switch on.
 * - MicroSwitch: secondary, non-energising settings.
 * - Annunciators: state flags, always present, lit when active.
 * - RotaryDial / Selector: mutually exclusive functions, modes and ranges.
 * - Bargraph / Sparkline: fraction of range, recent history.
 * - ContextMenu: secondary actions on a thing (right-click / context-menu key), e.g. recording a reading.
 * - Confirmation (`confirm.ts`): after a change is sent, the control pulses (`data-confirm="waiting"`)
 *   until the instrument reports the new value; after 6 s without it a red dot marks it "unconfirmed".
