//! The extension point of a BenchMesh distribution (contract `ai_context/OPEN_CORE.md`).
//!
//! The open-source build has no extensions: `benchmesh-server` and the desktop app built from this
//! repository pass `Extensions::default()`. The official distribution adds its own (app updates,
//! online services, finding instruments) at build time through the `benchmesh-extensions` crate,
//! which the desktop app asks for them. An extension adds routes to the same API: they are served behind the same
//! cross-site guard and remote gate, and their remote scope follows their path like every other
//! route (`remote::scope`; an unclassified path is local-only).
